# ssh_connect Project

This project contains a Bash script for connecting to a server using SSH with a private key.

**Requirements:**

* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Editors: vi, vim, emacs
* Script permissions: Executable

**Files:**

* README.md: This file (you're reading it now)
* connect_to_server.sh: The Bash script for SSH connection

**Instructions:**

1. Edit `connect_to_server.sh` to replace `"your_server_address"` with your actual server address.
2. Make the script executable using `chmod +x connect_to_server.sh`.
3. Run the script using `./connect_to_server.sh`.

**Security Considerations:**

* Avoid storing the server address directly in the script. Consider environment variables or configuration files.
* Be cautious about running scripts with elevated privileges.

**Note:** This project demonstrates basic functionality. Consider passwordless sudo and other security measures for production use.
